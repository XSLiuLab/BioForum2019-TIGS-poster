# Abstract

Immunotherapy, represented by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), is transforming the treatment of cancer. However, only a small percentage of patients show response to ICI, and there is an unmet need for biomarkers that will identify patients more likely to respond to ICI. The fundamental basis for ICI response is the immunogenicity of tumor, which is primarily determined by tumor antigenicity and antigen presentation efficiency. Here we propose a method to measure tumor immunogenicity score (TIGS), which combines tumor mutational burden (TMB) and antigen processing and presenting machinery (APM) gene expression signature. In both pan-cancer ICI objective response rates correlation and ICI clinical response prediction for individual patients, TIGS showed consistently improved performance compared to TMB and other known ICI response prediction biomarkers. This study suggests that the tumor immunogenicity score is an effective tumor inherent biomarker for ICI response prediction.

# Conclusion

- TIGS exhibits improved pan-cancer ICI objective response rate correlation, and ICI clinical response prediction accuracy compared with TMB.
- TIGS represents a novel and effective tumor inherent biomarker for immunotherapy response prediction.
